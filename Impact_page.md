- 主标题：Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- 内容：
Q: Do I need to have a website to join the program? A: No. As long as you have any promotional channels—such as communities, social media, or forums—you are eligible to apply.
Q: How often are commissions paid? A: Commissions are settled monthly by default on the Impact platform. You can withdraw to PayPal (2% fee per withdrawal, capped at $20) or to a bank account (flat $12 fee per withdrawal).
Q: Which products are eligible for commissions, and what are the rates? A: Commissionable products include: Simple Application Server (ULightHost), Elastic Compute (UHost) and Simple Application Server (ULightHost). Commission rates: 20% for monthly billing, and 5% for annual billing. For full details, please refer to the partnership agreement during the application process.
Q: What does "Item SKU" refer to in the contract? Is the commission only applicable to the first order?
A:
Item SKU refers to the unique ID assigned to a specific product, which is used to track each transaction in reports. For example, 1 represents servers (including categories like UHost and GPU UHost, but excluding disks and bandwidth), while 370 refers to ULightHost.
Item Category = 1 indicates a new purchase order. However, this does not mean the customer’s very first order — it refers to any new orders placed within 90 days of registration, excluding renewals.
